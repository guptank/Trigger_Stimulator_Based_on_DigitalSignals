# **LABVIEW Code for Digital Pulse and Trigger Output**

The LABVIEW code is designed to interface with the **NIDAQ 6001** to read digital pulses from hardware. Based on the received pulse, the code sends an analog input trigger to the **Digitimer DS5**, allowing for precise control and synchronization of external hardware based on user-defined requirements.

## **System Overview**
- **Hardware**:
  - **NIDAQ 6001**: Used to receive digital pulse signals from the hardware.
  - **Digitimer DS5**: Receives trigger signals from the LABVIEW code to control external stimuli or devices based on user configuration.

- **Functionality**:
  - The code reads the **digital pulse** generated by the connected hardware via the NIDAQ 6001 device.
  - It then processes the pulse data and sends an **analog trigger signal** to the **Digitimer DS5** based on user-defined settings.
  
## **Requirements:**
- **LABVIEW** software installed.
- **NIDAQ 6001** hardware for pulse reading.
- **Digitimer DS5** for external stimulus control.

## **How It Works:**
1. **Receiving Digital Pulse**:
    - The NIDAQ 6001 reads the **digital pulse** from the connected hardware.
    
2. **User Configuration**:
    - The user specifies parameters such as timing, trigger type, and pulse frequency within the **LABVIEW interface**.
    
3. **Analog Trigger Output**:
    - Based on the userâ€™s settings, the **LABVIEW code** converts the digital pulse into a corresponding **analog trigger signal**.
    - This trigger signal is sent to the **Digitimer DS5**, activating the connected equipment or stimulus.

4. **Timing and Synchronization**:
    - The **LABVIEW code** ensures precise synchronization between the digital pulse input and the analog trigger output, based on the user-defined parameters.

## **Steps to Run:**
1. **Connect the NIDAQ 6001 to the hardware** to receive the digital pulse.
2. **Set up the Digitimer DS5** to receive analog triggers from the LABVIEW code.
3. **Configure user settings** for the trigger (e.g., timing, duration, frequency) in the LABVIEW interface.
4. **Run the LABVIEW code**, which will:
   - Read the digital pulse.
   - Process and convert the signal.
   - Send the corresponding analog trigger to the **Digitimer DS5**.

## **Use Case Example:**
- **Pulse Timing**: User wants to trigger an external device with a delay based on the digital pulse received from the hardware.
- **Trigger Signal**: The LABVIEW code processes the incoming pulse and sends a corresponding analog trigger to the **Digitimer DS5** with a predefined timing and trigger characteristics (e.g., pulse width, frequency, etc.).
